## Information
The repository contains two folders: 
1. Main system that runs the road accident detection program
2. Image classification model folder
--- 
## Image Classification Model Folder
It includes dataset used during model training and testing. Inside, there is a main dataset folder structured into train, valid, and test subfolders. Additionally, two separate test image folders are provided.
The model has undergone two training phases, including fine-tuning. Therefore, a fineTuneDataset folder is also included, which was used for the fine-tuning process. Model training was performed using a Kaggle notebook, and the notebook file is attached as well.
